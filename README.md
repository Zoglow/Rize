# Rize
Simple flashcard app that allows user to add notes/example sentences to the cards.

The original proposal for Rize stated that it would be a simple flashcard app with three main functions: 
1. The ability to put a card back in the "deck" to be reviewed again
2. The ability to dispose of cards that do not need to be reviewed again
3. The ability to add example sentences, or any other kind of note, to a card at any point while the user is reviewing it

In the final project, these three main features are implemented, as well as the implementation of a GUI to interact with.

### Instructions:

1. Click the middle button (with the word) to flip the card over
2. Type into the text field and click the "Add note" button to add a note to the card
3. Click the right button to place the card at the back of the deck for reviewing again later
4. Click the left button to discard the card and not review it again. Finish running through the deck by clicking this button until the ending screen is reached
